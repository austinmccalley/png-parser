# PNG Parser

I originally started this project to work on BiCubic interpolation. I then got side tracked and started writting a PNG parser based off of the resources listed below

## Resources

- [PNG Standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/)
- [PNG Decoding with TypeScript](https://medium.com/achiev/understanding-and-decoding-png-format-example-in-ts-b31fdde1151b)

## Goals

1. Be able to fully decode a PNG image
2. Limit the amount of RAM usage
3. WASM module?
